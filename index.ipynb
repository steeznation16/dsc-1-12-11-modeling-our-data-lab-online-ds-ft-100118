If that's the case, it's always smart to start small, and go ahead and build linear regression models with just one input at the time. Somewhat like what we've done in section 10, let's look at some statistics for single linear regression models for all our *continuous* variables with the outcome.\n",

    "Running our 10-fold cross-validation highlights some issues for sure! Have a look at your list of 10 MSEs. Where most MSEs are manageable, some are very high. The cure of dimensionality is already pretty clear here. The issue is that we have many (dummy) categorical variables that result in columns with many zeroes and few ones. This means that for some folds, there is a risk of ending up with columns that almost exclusively contain 0's for prediction, which might cause weird results. Looking at this, a model with less predictors might make sense again. This is where we conclude for now. It's up to you now to explore other model options!
